Methodology:

Data Preparation: We cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: We created a synthetic feature 'time_of_day' based on work hours to categorize the day into Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night.

Model Training: We trained multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict the treatment status (indicative of mental health issues).

Evaluation: We evaluated the models using accuracy scores and selected the best-performing model for further analysis.

ðŸ“Š Key Findings:

Model Accuracy: The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy in predicting treatment status.

Feature Importance: Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we identified the most influential features affecting mental health.

Time of Day Impact: We observed distinct patterns in mental health status across different times of the day.

ðŸ•’ Insights Based on Time of Day:

Morning: Generally, people showed a positive mindset with lower treatment rates.

Afternoon: Slight increase in mental health issues, indicating work stress.

Evening: Noticeable dip in mindset, possibly due to work fatigue.

Night: Highest treatment rates, indicating stress and mental health issues.
